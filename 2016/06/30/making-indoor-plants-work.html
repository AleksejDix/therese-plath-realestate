<p>The 70’s trend is back so it’s time to bring the garden inside and bring new life to your interior.</p>

<p>If you feel like your home is lacking a little something, try adding some of these plants  to instantly lift a space and make it feel fresh and welcoming.</p>

<p><strong>Fiddle Leaf Fig</strong>
Loved for their large, glossy leaves, the Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata) are the ‘it’ plant of the moment.</p>

<p>This plant adds a sculptural element and wow factor to a room. Be sure to place in an area that gets bright filtered light, but not direct sunlight so the leaves don’t burn. As they come from a tropical climate, it is advised to keep the plant steadily moist and in a warm room if possible.</p>

<p><strong>String of Bananas</strong>
This trailing succulent produces long tendrils of tiny green banana-like leaves. String of Bananas (Senecio radicans) looks great in hanging baskets or on windowsills where the foliage can trail.</p>

<p>The String of Bananas enjoys filtered sunlight and being a succulent, only needs watering when the soil is dry. They like porous soil with good drainage. NOTE: This plant may be toxic to pets so place somewhere where they aren’t able to access it.</p>

<p><strong>Mother In Law’s Tongue</strong>
Besides being a great conversation starter with its name, the Mother in Law’s Tongue - named for their long, sharpley-shaped leaves - are enjoying a revival back into home decor fashion.</p>

<p>Adding structure to modern, contemporary and retro structures, the Mother in Law’s Tongue is a sturdy plant who can tolerate most conditions, though prefers full, bright sunlight. They only require water once a month and will die if you over water them.</p>
