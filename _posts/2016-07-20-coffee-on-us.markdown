Summary: A fun-filled morning of coffee and cake from the guys at domain.com.au

Yesterday - 19th July, we had the domain.com.au coffee van down at the office to warm our clients up on a raining and miserable morning.

It was a wonderful morning with plenty of fun had by all, though we all needed a nap after enjoying a few too many cookies and muffins!
